Thank You for downloading tinyhyphenator!
Include "tinyhyphenator.h" in your project and
add "tinyhyphenator.cpp" to the projects source files.

If there are any bugs or you want to add features,
such as providing configurations for other languages,
don't hesitate to do so (You should have write
access to the svn in sourceforge :D )!

Have fun!
